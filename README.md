# Flight_Reservation_Project

This Project is based on the Spring Boot Application. Here are the following points that I develope this project:-
(a):- Designing and implementing ApI's using Restful Webservices.
(b):- I had develope here restcontroller layer, entity layer, dto, repository, services, utilities etc.
(c):- I had create Microservices layer to connect with different application which is present in checkin folder.
(d):- I uses postman for software testing API.

Note:- The checkin project is a part of Flight_Reservation_Project which I used it as Microservices.
